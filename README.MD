# Chemistry Molecular Geometry AR Interactive
A simple and immersive AR application that allows you to visualize the molecular geometry of a molecule. Understanding the molecular geometry of a molecule is important in chemistry because it helps us understand the shape of the molecule and how it interacts with other molecules. 

## Usage
- View it on your phone by visiting this link: https://thisistim.dev/chemar
- In order for the model to appear, you must have a [Hiro marker](https://stemkoski.github.io/AR-Examples/markers/hiro.png) printed out or on a different device to see the 3D models.
- You can also host this application on your own server.

## How it works
This web app uses [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/) to detect the Hiro marker and then displays the 3D model of the molecule.

## Accessing the 3D models
All 3D models are stored as `.glb` files with Draco compression. For more information on obtaining the models from the CDN, see this [guide.](https://github.com/Piflyer/cdn)
